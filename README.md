# Nocturne

Welcome to Nocturne, a world ensnared in eternal darkness, where the veil between light and shadow is forever blurred. This README provides an overview of the fundamental aspects of the Nocturne setting.

## World Background

Nocturne is a realm suspended in perpetual night, its cities and landscapes cloaked in an unending darkness. A mysterious cosmic event arrested the world's rotation, casting one hemisphere into an eternal night. The emergence of Resonance Sickness, a cryptic ailment, mutates victims into shadowy constructs under the influence of encroaching darkness.

## Rulers and Subjects

The Hegemony commands the luminous beacons that sustain human existence amidst a world that has long ceased to be habitable. Yet, within the lower echelons of society, power is fragmented among factions controlling specific territories.

## Artificial Light Source

A coalition of Artificers and Wizards has erected an artificial light source (ALS), harnessing a novel and potent method to draw energy from the pervasive darkness. This coalition, known as the Hegemony, governs all artificial light sources scattered throughout Nocturne.
