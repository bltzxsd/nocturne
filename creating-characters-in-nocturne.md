# Creating Characters in Nocturne

1. Player characters (**PCs**) in Nocturne must begin as a humanoid race, selecting one from the Player's Handbook. If a sub-race option is available, you may choose one to further customize your character.

2. Choose your character's class, set it to level 3, and then select a subclass. Multiclassing is allowed with appropriate thematic reasons.

3. When choosing your class, roll your class's hit dice for each level you take. You are permitted to reroll HP only on two occasions throughout the course of their progression.

4. Calculate your character's stats using the point-buy system with a maximum of 27 points.

5. While alignment is not a mandatory aspect of character creation, you can opt for a lawful/chaotic and good/neutral alignment to provide a basic moral and ethical framework for your character.

6. Select your character's background, limited to those available in the Player's Handbook. If none align with your character concept, you may consult this:

   ?> _**Example:** Sylas Thorn, a rogue with a shadowy past, didn't find a suitable background, so he crafted his own: His **"Ear to the Ground"** feature helped him gather secrets from the underworld, and he gained proficiency in **stealth** and **perception** to keep himself hidden and aware. With skills honed by years of evading danger, he's now a master of subterfuge, skilled in **forgery** and **woodcarving**._

7. Choose any proficiencies and languages that suit your character's background and concept.

8. If your character possesses the spellcasting feature, select the appropriate spells.

   ?> _**Note:** Characters may not select or use any form of _revive_ or _resurrection_ on any Non-Player-Characters._

9. Determine your character's starting equipment, which may include gear from your chosen class, background, and any personal preferences.

10. Upon creation, work with the DM to create an event that afflicted your character with the resonance sickness.

You are now ready to play!
