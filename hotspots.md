# Resonance Hotspots in Nocture

The energy required to light up hundreds of thousants of square kilometers is not easy to create. However due to discoveries of the Hegemony, the resonance emitted by the world can be channeled into creating artificial light sources. This energy can be harvested by using materials that change their properties when under intense frequencies. The only places that naturally generate resonance are hotspots around the world of Nocturne. Currently, there are two types of hotspots. The ones that distort the spatial senses and the ones that distort temporal senses.

1. Resonance hotspots, accelerate the progression of Resonance Sickness but only those affected by the sickness can stay inside long enough to harvest this energy. Spatial distortion is common and such large machinery is prone to having its parts re-arranged and decommissioned within minutes.

2. Temporal Hotspots, much more rare than the resonance hotspots, they distort the sense of time by random significant amounts. Machinery either rusts or breaks down within seconds in these zones. The Hegemony has a strict restriction of who can and cannot enter these areas with their constant hunt and vigilance and this has led to many theories about what actually lies behind this thick surveillance.

## Effects on life

Hotspots are anomalies and place immense pressure on any life. Entering a hotspot without being acclimated to the resonance will make the body jump from the initial stages of the sickness to the final in at a moments notice. This is fatal 100% of the time.

## Use of Resonance

Resonance can be harvested, extracted and channeled from hotspots using resonance patterns.
These patterns are hypergeometric in nature and made by specialist wizard scribes.
