# Resonance Sickness

Resonance Sickness, born from perpetual darkness, is an affliction that degrades the mind and body of the victim unfortunate enough to succumb to its grasp. As shadows wrap around the infected, a tune of unnatural frequencies courses through their veins, disrupting the harmony of their very essence. Not much is known about this incurable curse affecting a very small amount of people. Some say people tuned to the world have higher susceptibility but  further research has hit dead ends.

## Stages of Affliction

1. The initial stage sees the victim experiencing fatigue and disorientation.

1. Intermediary stages are unique among induviduals and their tolerances. The high tolerance afflicted have a noticeably refined control over synthetic parts of their body.

1. The final stage witnesses the complete metamorphosis. The victim is consumed by the shadows, transforming into a construct controlled by the perpetual darkness. The once-person is lost, a mere echo of their former self.

## Side Effects

The affected can enter and leave resonance hotspots without losing their minds instantly to forces of nature. Most of these energy generators are controlled by the Hegemony.
