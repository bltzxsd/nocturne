# What is Nocturne?

Nocturne, is a world which has stopped spinning. Based in science-fantasy, it takes influence from media such as Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Cyberpunk, Forgotten Realms. The world does not necessarily behave in a strict setting.

1. The world has stopped spinning confining humanity to darkness. No one can get to the other side of the world due to a large veil of shadow preventing movement across hemispheres. All contact and communication between are lost.
1. In control is the Hegemony, which controls the large artificial light sources (ASLs) located in cities and places of cultural, militaristic and academic importance.
1. These artificial light sources are powered by resonance enhanced materials harvested from resonance hotspots.
1. Since, these light sources came about with the joint forces of artificers and wizards, utmost importance is placed upon academics and scientific progress.
